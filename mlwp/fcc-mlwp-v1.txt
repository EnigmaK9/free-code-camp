# artificial intelligence
AI = The effort to automate intellectual tasks
1950 
Can computers think?
Artificial intelligence was coined during this time
AI for chess. Predefined rules typed into the computer
No ML, no DL. You need to tell it beforehand.
very good AI was a good set of rules.
Half a million lines of code 
AI does not mean nothing necessary complex
Simulate playing a game
AI of tiktaktoe
Machine learning, deep learning
Drawing a circle
AI considered artificial intelligence
Machine learning
Chess, check move somewhere else
ML: first field figuring out the rules for us.
Take the data, and figure out the rule of us.
Ton of examples, a lot of input data, etc
ML works generating the rules for us
Looks at what rules can be generated
100% accuracy does not get the right
answer all the time
fewest mistakes possible.
Try to simulate human behavior
Rather than giving the program the rules
an algorithm finds the rules for us.
Machine learning
neural networks: 
- hype
- a form of ml
- layered representation of data
- layers
Our data is transformed in different layers
Difficult to explain neural networks
Multiple layers
Multiple stage information extraction
Output layer, until we find every single bit of
- we don't need a predefined set of layers
- Modelled after the brain. No
- Biological inspiration, but not modelled neccesary
- from our brain. don't know information is 
- transferred into our brain.

- Key thing to create models
- Unless you are using a very specific type of ML
- We know how ML works
- We have some input information, labels
- Start training to be able 
- What should be
- Data what we have, all the inputs and all the labels
- I hope that makes sense.
- Incorrect input or output, we will have problems
- Types of ML
Which statement below is false?
a. Neural networks are modeled after the way the human brain works.
b. Computer programs that play tic-tac-toe or chess against human players are 
examples of simple artificial intelligence.
c. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.
